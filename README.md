### Netlify

We launched our client on Netlify!

- [About Time](https://about-time.netlify.app)

## The Process
1. We first set up a kanban board on trello and used slack to have our initial discussions in order to decide on components, features and other tasks that would be needed to make the brief a reality.
2. Colour schemes, fonts and a logo were decided via vote.
3. We then further made use of Excalidraw to sketch out designs for our pages and schema. 
4. We initially started with a backend team consisting of server setup, database setup and the implimentation of socket.io .
5. The frontend team were responsible for creating the design and layout of the application based off the initial planning. This included the components, pages, navigation and style.
6. The front and backend were deployed early on in the process to ensure any deployment issues were identified early in the process.
7. Both teams were responsible for the logic that would underpin the running of the application.
8. Testing was carried out at every day with a report generated for the end of the day.
9. Changes were commited regularly and each developer worked on their own branches before merging to a staging branch. The changes from the staging branch    were merged into main once they were approved.
10. Once the various components were functioning we began the process of connecting the flow of information and refining our logic.
11. When problems arose they were either solved by individual team-members or a group effort was required.
12. As the application functioned as we envisioned we then undertook a redesign of the styling to aid playability.
13. Any further bugs were ironed out.
14. Further work was undertaken on testing to generate a suitable level of coverage.
