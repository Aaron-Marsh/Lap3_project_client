                    <p>The question will be displayed on your screen, at which point you will be given 10 seconds to choose an answer. 
                    
                    Once you choose an answer the tile will either flash green for correct or red for incorrect.
                    
                    The amount of points you are awarded for a correct answer is calculated by our very clever algorithm which takes the time left and multiplies by a secret value.
                    
                    Current scores and game Leaderboards are displayed in your window.</p>
